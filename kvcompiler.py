Batch Binding
=============

An explanation of :attr:`KVCompiler.batch_bind`.

When `False`, bindings occur mostly like in the past, except for some
    optimizations.

    When `True`, bindings will batched across all the KV rules, even rules
    defined in other compiled files (if it was compiled with batch_bind=True).
    Consider the following KV rules::

        <RuleA@BoxLayout>:
            Label:
                my_size: root.size

        <RuleB@Button>:
            RuleA:
                on_parent: self.size = 25, 25
                size: self.x + 1, self.y + 1

    When `RuleB is created with e.g. `RuleB()`, if `batch_bind` is False, the
    following occurs to the `RuleA` child object:

    #. The `RuleaA` object is created by `RuleaB`.
    #. The `<RuleA@BoxLayout>` rule is applied.
    #. The `<RuleB@Button>` rules are applied to `RuleA`.
    #. For each rule, when it was applied, the following overall steps occurred
       during rule application.
       #. The rule's children are created (e.g. `Label` in `RuleA`)
       #. All the property rules that are set by literals (e.g.
          `size_hint: None, None`, or `prop: self`) are initialized to those
          values.
       #. All the property rules that are set by non-literals (e.g.
          `size: self.x + 25, self.y + 33`) are initialized to those values.
       #. All the required bindings are created.
       #. All the non-literal property rules (e.g.
          `size: self.x + 25, self.y + 33`) are re-evaluated to ensure non
          are stale.
       #. All the `on_prop` rules (e.g. `on_parent: self.size = 25, 25`) that
          should have been triggered during the previous stages are triggered.
       #. For every child widget of the current root rule, e.g. `RuleA` for
          `<RuleB@Button>` and `Label` for `<RuleA@BoxLayout>`, the
          `on_kv_apply` event is dispatched indicating that the current rule
          is done. In each case, the root object of the current rule (e.g.
          `RuleB` and `RuleA`, respectively) is the parameter to the
          event. When this event is dispatched, we're guaranteed that all the
          rules to the object being dispatched is done, but the rules to e.g.
          its parents may not be fully applied yet.
       #. The root rule dispatches `on_kv_apply` to itself indicating that its
          rules are done.
       Specifically, all these steps were done for RuleA using it's
       `<RuleA@BoxLayout>` rule followed by all the steps for its rules from
       `<RuleB@Button>`.

    Consider the following example based on the above code that demonstrates
    this::

        class MyLabel(Label):
            my_size = ListProperty([])

            def __init__(self, **kwargs):
                super(MyLabel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
                def do_my_size(*l):
                    print(self.my_size)
                self.bind(my_size=do_my_size)

        w = Builder.compile_load_string(\'''
        <RuleA@BoxLayout>:
            MyLabel:
                my_size: root.size

        <RuleB@Button>:
            RuleA:
                on_parent: self.size = 25, 25
                size: self.x + 1, self.y + 1

        RuleB
        \''', batch_bind=False)

    When executed as such, or if `Builder.load_string` is used, it outputs the
    following::

        [100, 100]
        [1, 1]
        [25, 25]

    The reason is that: first, for the initialization phase of `RuleA`,
    `my_size` gets set to the value of `root.size` which is `100, 100` and is
    then set to track `root.size`.

    Then, the `RuleB` is applied and size is initialized to
    `size: self.x + 1, self.y + 1`, hence the `1, 1`, and finally, at the end,
    `on_parent: self.size = 25, 25` is executed resulting in `25, 25` being the
    value of `my_size`.

    On the other hand, if `batch_bind=True` was used instead in the code above,
    the output of the above code would just be::

        [100, 100]
        [25, 25]

    That's because with `batch_bind` True, rule application is batched as three
    phases: initialization, binding, and post-initialization. In particular, we
    gather all the KV rules, including inherited rules both for the root
    widget and all its children and perform each phase on all the rules bfore
    going to the next phase. Specifically, when `RuleB is created with e.g.
    `RuleB()`, the following occurs to the `RuleA` child object:

    #. The `RuleaA` object is created by `RuleaB`.
    #. In the initialization step, we combine the `<RuleA@BoxLayout>` rules and
       the `<RuleB@Button>` RuleA applicable rules and do the following overall
       steps.
       #. The rule's children are created (e.g. `Label` in `RuleA`)
       #. All the property rules that are set by literals (like in
          `batch_bind=False`) are initialized to those values.
       #. All the property rules that are set by non-literals
          are initialized to those values.
    #. In the binding phase we create the bindings for all the rules.
    #. In the third phase, post initialization is done as follows:
       #. All the non-literal property rules are re-evaluated to ensure non
          are stale.
       #. All the `on_prop` rules (e.g. `on_parent: self.size = 25, 25`) that
          should have been triggered during the previous stages are triggered.
       #. For every child widget of all the rules, e.g. `RuleA` and `Label` the
          `on_kv_apply` event is dispatched indicating that **ALL** the rules
          are done being applied. For all, the root object of the topmost rule
          (the `RuleB` object above) is the parameter to the
          event. When this event is dispatched, we're guaranteed that all the
          rules to the object and its parents are done. That means **ALL** KV
          rules that are applicable to the widget and all its children
          are fully applied.
       #. The root rule (`RuleB` above) dispatches `on_kv_apply` to itself
          in `__init__` indicating that its rules are done.

    The order of the three phases is also specific as follows.
    #. In the initialization phase, inherited rules are applied first. E.g.
       initialization of `<RuleA@BoxLayout>` is done before `<RuleB@Button>`.
    #. The binding phase order follows exactly as the initialization order.
    #. The post initialization order is the reverse of the initialization order.
       That is, inherited rules are post initialized after derived rules.
       Specifically, `<RuleB@Button>` is post initialized, followed by
       `<RuleA@BoxLayout>`.

    The justification for this order is that for initialization, it's expected
    that parent rules are initialized before children rules as is done
    currently. However, the goal of post initialization is to trigger and update
    the rules that need to be updated. It is more common in KV that children
    are  sized or follow the properties of the parents than the reverse.
    Similarly, it should be expected that newer rules drive previous rules
    more than the opposite (this argument is not very strong). Consequently,
    updating the rules from staring with the newer rules is probably more
    efficient (see the example how that plays out).

    Consequently, during the initialization step we `my_size` is set to the
    current value of `root.size` (which is `100, 100`), and `size` is set first
    to `100, 100`, the default, and then to `self.x + 1, self.y + 1`. However,
    because no bindings has been created, `my_size` is not yet tracking `size`
    so it's value is not changed when `size` is changed.

    Finally, during post-initialization, `size` is again updated to
    `size: self.x + 1, self.y + 1`, but since it already had the value of
    `1, 1` it's not dispatched and doesn't update `my_size`. Then,
    `on_parent: self.size = 25, 25` is executed setting the size to `25, 25`,
    hence the print. Finally, `my_size: root.size` is again evaluated, but
    it doesn't change `my_size`.

    The overall result is that `batch_bind=True` resulted in less dispatching
    and property updating during initialization and binding creation.



Instantiation
===================

When a widget is created using the syntax `w = WidgetClass()`, the KV rules
associated with the class `WidgetClass` are applied to the instance before
it returns from its `__init__` method. The KV rules are applied in a specific
sequence of operations, some of which are batched. Consider the following KV
rules::

    <MyWidgetA@Widget>:
        width: 10
        prop: wid.myself
        height: self.width
        Button:
            id: wid
            myself: self
            MyWidgetC
            canvas:
                Color:
                    rgba: 1, 0, 1, 1
                Rectangle:
                    size: 10, 10
        MyWidgetB

    <MyWidgetB@Widget>:
        size_hint: None, None
        BoxLayout:
            MyWidgetC
        canvas:
            Line

    <MyWidgetC@Widget>:
        Label
        FloatLayout
            GridLayout


We can convert these rules to the following widget/graphics children tree

.. image:: images/kvrules1.png
    :align: right

Overall, when `w = MyWidgetA()` is executed and python calls its `__init__`
method, 4 steps occur:

#. __Initialization step__: For each KV rule that can be reached from the root
   `MyWidgetA` rule, all the widgets and graphics instructions are created.
   Also, all the _widget_ properties defined in the rules, e.g.
   `prop: prop_value` are initialized to those values.
#. __Binding step__: All the _graphics_ properties defined in the rules, e.g.
   `rgba: rgba_value` are initialized to those values. Followed by the creation
   of the bindings for every rule defined in KV, e.g. `prop: prop_value`, or
   `on_prop: do_func()`.


# For every widget or graphics instruction encountered in the rule
1. Walk through the widget tree generated from the kv rules associated with
   `the current widget` starting with `MyWidgetA` in a depth first manner.




Property Creation
-----------------

The first time a widget of any class type is created, we ensure that all the
properties set by the KV rule for that class exists - whether they are kivy or
python properties.

Consider the following KV rule::

    <RuleA@Label>:
        prop1: self.text
        prop2: 0.42

When the first `RuleA` is created, we check whether `prop1` and `prop2` exists
as attributes of the RuleA instance - whether as a proper kivy property or a
python property. If any don't exist, they are created dynamically as kivy
properties.

For such dynamically created properties, if the value of the rule
is a literal as described below, the type of the property created
is matched as close to the type of the value of the rule as possible
(e.g. a NumericProperty is created for 0.42) and the property is initialized
to that value. Otherwise, a `ObjectProperty` initialized to `None` is created.


Initialization
---------------

After the widgets and graphics instructions are created, and after we ensure
all properties set by the rules exist, the initialization step begins.

Initialization is split into three periods; literal initialization, non-literal
initialization, and graphical initialization.


Graphics Instructions
=====================

They are not instantly exec but are delayed.


Proxy refs
==========
direct refs are not stored

TODO:

#. Should args be initialized when the properties are executed so that they are
   available in that context? Can they be set to None, or do we actually have
   to set them to their real values? Which costs perfs. In the past it was
   None.
#. Clean up and doc :class:`KVCompiler`.
#. Decide whether to batch bind.
#. Try cython again.
#. Add docs to binding in compiled code.

        KV rules associated with widget :attr:`name`. This is returned whether
        it's a graphical or widget instance attribute being set by the rule.

        `funcs`: is the function definitions and code of the `__h` functions
            bound and called to execute the KV rule and set the property.
        `bindings`: is a list of 7-tuples `(sname, prop_name, f, fargs,
            keys, delayed, comment)` use to create the bindings.
            `sname`: is :attr:`self_name`.
            `prop_name`: is the property name being set by the rule.
            `f`: is the function name in `funcs` associated with the rule.
            `fargs`: is the list of objects (e.g. widgets) that need to be
                passed to the function `f` upon a callback.
            `keys`: is a list of an attribute chain that the rule binds to.
                E.g. `prop: self.obj.name or self.cls.value`, will add two
                tuples to `bindings` whose respective `keys` are `['self',
                'obj', 'name']`, and `['self', 'cls', 'value']`.
            `delayed`: is None if a widget instance attribute is set, otherwise
                a graphical attribute is set and this is of the form
                `__delayed_xxx` and is the list passed to `__delayed_call_fn`
                for scheduling a graphical update.
            `comment`: is a list of strings containing the comments describing
                the KV code that generated this rule.
        `inits`: is the list of code that initializes non-literals rules.
        `lit_init`: is the list of code that initializes literal rules (e.g.
            `prop: self` or `prop: 2.5`).
        `delayed_init`: is the code that schedules the initilization of rules
            that set attributes of graphics children using `__delayed_call_fn`.
